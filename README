A straight line track fitter for test beam analysis of pixel partickle detectors.

The implementation contains a Combinatorial Kalman Filter for track finding, as well as
implementation of the standard formulation of the Kalman Filter, an information matrix
implementation of the Kalman Filter, and the Deterministic annealing filter. 

The implementations are template classes, taking the fitter type (double or float), and the
dimention of the fitter. The implementation currently only works for 4 parameters(straight
line tracks). Due to optimizations using the code for 5 parameters would require many
functions to be overloaded, not only in the propagation. 

Also contains an implementation of the methods for estimating material and resolutions of
several detector planes simultaneously, as described in the paper <-> in the class EstMat. An
application of the method on toy simulated data is also available.

Code for using the fitter and material estimator from the EUTELESCOPE software framework is
also included.

The track fitter(EUTelTrackerSystem, EUTelDafEigenFitter) depends on the linear algebra
package eigen2. The material and resolution estimator relies on the GNU scientific library
for minimization.

The simulation experiments use root for plotting.
